Hi, I'm Daihui, a power electronic engineer at Volvo focusing on electric motor drive systems. My work covers the modelling of DC-link capacitors and their lifetime evaluation, EMC optimization and the gate driver PCBs' design in inverter systems.

I'm experienced in common/differential-mode filter designs, inverter modulation methods and the related controller design. Also, I am involved in system-level EMC simulation.
